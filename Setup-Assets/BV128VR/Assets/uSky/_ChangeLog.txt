uSky 1.1.2 Change Log
=======================

*********************************************************************************************************
NOTE:  THIS WILL BE THE LAST VERSION THAT SUPPORT UNITY 4, NEXT UPDATE VERSION WILL SUPPORT UNITY 5 ONLY!
*********************************************************************************************************

- Changed "Night Zenith Color" color setting to gradient. That give user total control the night sky color from sunset to mid night. 
Now default night sky color is slightly darker.

- In Unity 5, Reflection of the skybox Outer Space cubemap has been enabled. Especially when user set the "Outer Space intnesity" to very high or apply a bright custom galaxy cubemap that 
it will be reflected in the reflective materials as expected. 

- Added alternative "Distance Cloud Cheap" shader renders just simple flat shading for the cloud, it has been optimized for mobile usage.
Known issues: The cloud color get too dark when applied Camera Tonemapping in Gamma Color Space.

- Improved "Distance cloud" material will always stay color correctly in Unity 4 Editor even if it is not in focus.

- Improved automatic detection for color space when the color space has changed. Now all sky settings will get refresh and switch to correct color.



uSky 1.1.1 Change Log
=======================
- Changed the "Sky Tint" color setting to shift wavelenghts range directly instead of multiply the existing sky color. 
The skybox shader has slightly less calculation. Now the neutral value of "Sky Tint" is grey color (128).

- Added bonus "uSkymap" Renderer for Scrawk's Ocean material ("Ocean BRDF" and "Ocean White Caps"). 
uSkymap will work in Unity 4 (Pro only) and 5. "uSkymapRenderer" will render and apply the uSkymap RenderTexture to the Ocean Material.
Note: This update does not include Scrawk's Ocean project and you need to import it and implement it yourself. If you need help, feel free to ask me.
If you don't need it, feel free to remove "Bonus" folder from your project.

- Distance cloud has own default layerMask at "Layer 18". This setting has not expose in Inspector, but you can change to different layer in the Distancecloud.cs script.
In Unity 5, you can add a name "cloud" to Layer 18, it allows Reflection Probe camera set the "culling mask" that render the cloud layer only, or no render it.

- Fixed some Skybox shader bugs for better "Oculus Rift" support.

- Removed uSkyManager's Skybox Preview in the inspector. It has no cloud preview, so it seems really useless.




uSky 1.1.0f2 Change Log
=======================
- Renamed "Time of day" setting to "Timeline". Avoid naming confusion from other asset package.

- Added "Ambient Gradient" and "Ambient Intensity" that control the RenderSetting Ambient. 
It can be easily manual predefined Ambient Gradient color for different Timeline.
In Unity 4, it will show the Light Color gradient only that will be directly use as RenderSetting Ambient,
This will balance default Light Color (yellowish) and Sky Color (bluish) Ambient lighting even the scene is not using any IBL material.
In Unity 5, Ambient Gradient will be use as ambient color only if "Ambient Source" set to "Gradient" in Lighting window setting.

At the current Unity 5, only Ambient Gradient seems work well for update the ambient in runtime build.
 
- Introduce a new "DistanceCloud beta". It is a sky cloud renderer on the hemisphere mesh. 
Implemented two type of texture mapping of your choice: "Rectangular" and "Polar", both methods can be easily switch within the material setting. 
The cloud color is based on predefined "Light Color" and "Sky color" Ambient Gradient, which not related to skybox color.

In Unity 5 the cloud will automatically render via any reflection probe's camera inside the Editor and Runtime. 
At the moment, the cloud will not render in skybox reflection (from Lighting window setting).
So it only affect the object has reflective material in the scene, will not affect the ambient color lighting.

- Removed "Linear Space" setting, now it will automatically detect the color space and skybox will automatically switch to correct color. 

- Removed the "Density Scale" and "Sunset Time Offset" That combined with single "Rayleigh Scattering" setting. 
It behaves similar to "Atmoshpere Thickness" from the Unity 5 Default-Skybox and behavior now match the description in the documentation.   

- Renamed "Moon Inner Corona Color" to "Moon Inner Corona" and combined "Moon Inner Corona Scale" into the "Moon Inner Corona"s alpha.

- Renamed "Moon Outer Corona Color" to "Moon Outer Corona" and combined "Moon Outer Corona Scale" into the "Moon Outer Corona"s alpha.

- Improved default "Moon Outer Corona Scale" value that now behaves more consistently between Linear/Gamma space and when Tonemapping is using.

- The Sun and Moon Light will auto Enable/Disable when it has no affect to the scene lighting. 

- Since Unity 5 Beta 22 ligthing changed, so uSkyLight changed the default value of sun intensity from 0.5 to 1.0, and default moon intensity from 0.1 to 0.4.

- Changed Color correction of the Skybox in linear space that it uses power of 2.0 now instead of 2.2. Slightly more peformance friently.

- Changed default "Star Intensity" value from 2 to 1, and the default Star flickering speed is little bit slower as well.

- Since Unity 5 fixed the skybox preview with linear color space issue, now preview has been enabled for unity 5.

- Default Sun Size is slightly smaller now.



uSky 1.0.1 Change Log
=======================
- Renamed Component "uSkyRenderer" to "uSkyManager".

- Added "Time Of Day" and "Longitude" sliders to control the full Day/Night cycle of the sun rotation.

- Added new "uSkyLight" script to manage the Sun and Moon lighting in the scene. Single editable "Gradient" to control the full Day/Night cycle of both Sun and Moon light color.
It included two sliders to control Sun and Moon intensity. 

- Added new Night Sky with "Moon", "Star Field" and "Outer Space Cubemap". Also added new Night Sky Parameters in uSkyManager.
Included the MilkyWay Cubemap that match up with stars position of "Star Field".

- Now the uSky "Exposure" becomes a global lighting exposure control for day time. It will affect final output of the Sun and Moon intensity with uSkyLight.

- Included the Unity 4 "uSky GUI Demo" scene that same as demo webplayer and included the GUI scripts.

- Combined the "Density Scale" and "Altitude Scale" to single "Density Scale" setting from range 0 to 4. 

- New "Night Zenith Color" will replace the "Sunset Zenith Color" through the night sky cycle. It still will affect on the sunset sky color.

- Changed smaller maxmium value of some sliders range and changed default sun is smaller as well.

- Renamed parameter "Directional Light" to "Sun Light".

- Renamed the end of "Wavelength" with "s" for correct spelling, now it is "Wavelengths".

- Updated the documentation.



uSky 1.0.0f2 Change Log
=======================
- Since Unity 5 beta 13 changed for a big and tessellated sphere mesh. Now some codes of uSky shader allows computing per-vertex based for better performance.
New update of the uSky shader that approximately run 10 ~ 20% faster. This performance gain is for Unity 5 beta 13 or newer users only, uSky shader for Unity 4 will remain the same.

* Note: Do not use the uSky shader for Unity 5 in Unity 4.x.x. 

- Removed the Directional Light in the Unity 5 uSkyRenderer Prefab. When apply this Prefab, user need to apply the Directional Light manually to uSkyRenderer.
(When Create or Start a new scene in Unity 5, default always included the Directional Light in the scene. So we removed it from Prefab for less confusion) 

- Small update on the uSkyRenderer.cs, better ground ambient between different color space.


uSky 1.0.0e Change Log
=======================
- Fixed Wavelength setting : the missing _betaR and _betaM values pass to shader.
